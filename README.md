* ## Scope in JavaScript is the concept that determines the accessibility and visibility of variables, objects, and functions in different parts of the code. Scope can affect how the code behaves and how the values of variables can change. There are different types of scope in JavaScript, such as:

{

let x = 2;

}
x
 can NOT be used here

{

var x = 2;


}

* ## Global scope in JavaScript is the context where everything in a JavaScript program executes by default. It includes all variables, objects, and references that are not contained within a customized scope defined by a programmer. Variables declared in the global scope can be accessed from anywhere in the JavaScript program. However, global variables can also cause problems such as name collisions, pollution of the global namespace, and difficulty in debugging. Therefore, it is recommended to use local scope or block scope whenever possible to limit the visibility and lifetime of variables. You can learn more about JavaScript scope from these sources:

* ## Function scope in JavaScript is the accessibility of variables, objects, and functions from different parts of the code. Variables that are declared inside a function have function scope, which means they can only be accessed from within that function. For example:

function myFunction() {

    
  var x = 10; // x has function scope


  console.log(x); // 10


}

myFunction();


console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is 


not defined

* ## In the example above, the variable x is declared inside the function myFunction using the var keyword. This means that x is only visible inside the function, and not outside of it. Trying to access x from outside the function will result in a ReferenceError.

 * ## Function scope also applies to variables declared with the let and const keywords, which were introduced in ES6. These keywords provide block scope, which means that variables declared inside a block (such as an if statement or a loop) are only visible inside that block. For example:

if (true) {

  let y = 20; // y has block scope


  console.log(y); // 20


}

console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined

 * ## In the example above, the variable y is declared inside the if block using the let keyword. This means that y is only visible inside the block, and not outside of it. Trying to access y from outside the block will result in a ReferenceError.

* ## Block scope in JavaScript is the context where variables declared with the keywords let or const are only accessible within a certain block of code, such as a loop, an if statement, or a switch statement. Block scope helps to avoid name collisions, pollution of the global namespace, and difficulty in debugging. For example, if you declare a variable with let or const inside a for loop, you cannot use that variable outside of the loop. You can see some examples of block scope in these sources:
